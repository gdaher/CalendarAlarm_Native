# CalendarAlarm_Native
What is does this application do?
This is a notification app that will send repeat notifications for scheduled events. It is not meant to replace a calendar. Rather it is a backup reminder for events you don't want to miss. Google calendar and iOS calendars don't give the option of repeat notifications, which can lead to missing appointments if you happen to be away from your phone when a notification fired. This application has only been tested for iPhone 6.

To run this code in the simulator, you will need:

1. Install Xcode
2. Install node
3. Install React Native CLI via "npm install -g react-native-cli"
3. Clone this repository to your machine and run the following command to start the simulation:
"react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone 6" "
